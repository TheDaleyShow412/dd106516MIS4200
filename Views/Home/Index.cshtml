            One of my extra ciricular involvements is the Center for Consumer Research and Analytics. In my

            Company to my current position of leading a project for Chase Bank. Check out the CRA with the button below!

        <p>Having served as the Vice President of AMA since the Spring of 2019 is something I am very proud of.
